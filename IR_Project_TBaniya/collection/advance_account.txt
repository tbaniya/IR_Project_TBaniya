ADVANCE ACCOUNT REQUEST FORM An Advance account p rovides the Principal Investigator (PI) with an opportunity to initiate sponsored research projects and begin incurring associated expenses prior to institutional acceptance of an award . Advance accounts allow PI's and departments to record and track expenditures and eliminate the need to charge other unrelated accounts and perform cost transfers at a later time. If the award does not materialize, the department will be responsible for all costs incurred on the advance account. It is important that funds not be spent before the period in which the sponsor expects to honor costs.

Welcome to the Loewenberg School of Nursing (LSON) logon page.  Please note the following BEFORE beginning the application process.




In order to apply to the LSON you must already be accepted into The University of Memphis as a degree seeking undergraduate student.
Admissions to The University of Memphis can take up to several weeks during peak times.  Please ensure you apply to The University of Memphis well in advance of the LSON deadlines which can be found at http://www.memphis.edu/nursing/apply.php.
You must have received your UUID in order to begin the LSON application process.  Information about UUIDs can be found at http://www.memphis.edu/itd/accounts/uuid.php.
Inaccurate completion of the LSON application (including, but not limited to, withholding or failing to list ALL colleges attended along with dates of attendance) will be considered falsification of your application and will make you ineligible for admission to the Loewenberg School of Nursing.  Please understand that you must also report the same information on your Admissions application to the University of Memphis.

I am a teacher at heart, and there are moments in the classroom when I can hardly hold the joy. When my students and I discover uncharted territory to explore, when the pathway out of a thicket opens up before us, when our experience is illuminated by the lightening - life of the mind then teaching is the finest work I know. - Parker Palmer, The Courage to Teach
